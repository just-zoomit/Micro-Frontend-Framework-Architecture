# If change made to Webpack, must restart server for it to take affect

# To Get Start, rum npm start in each folder. The container will have all of the mircofrontend.

# Requirement #1 for Inflexible Frontend Architecture:
* Zero coupling between child projects  

* No importing of functions/objects/classes./etc

* No shared state

* Shared libraries through Module Federation System is okay

# Requirement #2 for Inflexible Frontend Architecture:

* Nero-zero coupling between container and child apps

* Container shouldn't assume that a child is using a particular framework

* Any necessary communication done with callbacks or simple events


# Requirement #3 for Inflexible Frontend Architecture:

* CSS from one project shouldn’t affect another, CSS should be scoped and not shared. Change to one project, should not affect another.

# Requirement #4 for Inflexible Frontend Architecture:

* Version Control (mono-repo vs separate shouldn’t have any impact on the overall project) 
  
# Requirement #5 for Inflexible Frontend Architecture:
* Container should be able to decide to always use the latest version of a mirco-frontend or specify version    

** (1) Container will always use the latest version of a chid app (doesn’t require a redeploy of container)    

** (2) Container can specify exactly what version of a child it wants to use (requires a redeploy change)
